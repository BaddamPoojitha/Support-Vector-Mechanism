# Support-Vector-Mechanism
Project Title: Using a support vector mechanism algorithm of super vised machine Learning, Predict iris.csv dataset to find out spices will be same or different

Problem Statement:
A American based botnical garden grow iris flower in there labs but using bio techology in a single tree different types of variety flower is grow.As a data science engineer find out how much accuracy is there all categories contains same species.
Task1:Preprocess the data skit learn library
Task2:Load the data using sklearn model selection default argument
Task3:On the basis of your dataset train,test and split svm model
Task4:Implement support vector mechanism classifier using svm_classifier.The svm must be "Linear"
Task5:Train the classifier on the training data
Task6:Find out prediction value on the test data
Task7:Test the model with help of accuracy,accuracy should be lie in the range of 0 to 1

Conclusion:
According to my support vector mechanism model the species are linear with the accuracy of 1.00 Hence proved model was successfull implement
